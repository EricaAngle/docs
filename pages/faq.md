The FAQ should provide quick answers to the most common questions.

## What is Micro?

Micro is a microservice ecosystem focused on simplifying distributed systems development.

- Micro is a [framework](https://github.com/micro/go-micro)
- Micro is a [toolkit](https://github.com/micro/micro)
- Micro is a [community](http://slack.micro.mu/)
- Micro is an [ecosystem](https://micro.mu/explore/)

### Open Source

Micro consists of open source libraries and tools to help with microservice development.

- **go-micro** - A pluggable Go RPC framework for writing a microservice; service discovery, client/server rpc, pub/sub, etc.
- **go-plugins** - Plugins for go-micro including etcd, kubernetes, nats, rabbitmq, grpc, etc.
- **micro** - A microservice toolkit containing traditional entry points; API Gateway, CLI, Slack Bot, Proxy and Web UI.

Various other libraries and services can be found in [github.com/micro](https://github.com/micro).

### Community

There's a slack community with a thousand members. 

Invite yourself at [slack.micro.mu](http://slack.micro.mu/).

### Ecosystem

Micro spans beyond a single organisation. Open source tools and services are being contributed by the community itself.

Explore the ecosystem at [micro.mu/explore/](https://micro.mu/explore/).

## Where do I start?

Start with [go-micro](https://github.com/micro/go-micro). The readme provides a sample microservice.

Learn more by reading the [getting started](https://micro.mu/docs/writing-a-go-service.html) guide or checkout the [examples](https://github.com/micro/examples).

Use the [micro](https://github.com/micro/micro) toolkit to access microservices via the cli, web ui, slack or api gateway.

## Who's using Micro?

See the [users](https://micro.mu/docs/users.html) page with a list of companies using Micro (but note it may be out of date). 

Many more are also using it but not yet publicly listed. Feel free to add your company if you're using Micro.

## How do I use Micro?

It's quite simple.

1. Write services using [go-micro](https://github.com/micro/go-micro).
2. Access them via the [micro](https://github.com/micro/micro) toolkit.
3. Profit.

## Can I use something instead of Consul?

Yes! The registry for service discovery is completely pluggable as is every other package. Consul was used as the default due to its features and simplicity.

### Etcd

As an example. If you would like to use etcd, import the plugin and set the command line flags on your binary.

```go
import (
        _ "github.com/micro/go-plugins/registry/etcd"
)
```

```shell
service --registry=etcd --registry_address=127.0.0.1:2379
```

### Zero Dependency

There's a built in Multicast DNS service registry for a zero dependency configuration. 

Pass `--registry=mdns` or `MICRO_REGISTRY=mdns` to your application on startup.

## Where can I run Micro?

Micro is runtime agnostic. You can run it anywhere you like. On bare metal, on AWS, Google Cloud. On your favourite container orchestration system like Mesos or Kubernetes.

In fact there's demo config for Micro on Kubernetes. Check out the repo at [github.com/micro/kubernetes](https://github.com/micro/kubernetes)

## What's the difference between API, Web and SRV services?

<img src="images/arch.png" />

As part of the micro toolkit we attempt to define a set of design patterns for a scalable architecture by separating the concerns of the API, Web dashboards and backend services (SRV).

### API Services

API services are served by the micro api with the default namespace go.micro.api. The micro api conforms to the API gateway pattern. 

Learn more about it [here](https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/api)

### Web Services

Web services are served by the micro web with the default namespace go.micro.web. We believe in web apps as first class citizens in the microservice world therefor building web dashboards as microservices. The micro web is a reverse proxy and will forward HTTP requests to the appropriate web apps based on path to service resolution. 

Learn more about it [here](https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/web)

### SRV services

SRV services are basically standard RPC services, the usual kind of service you would write. We usually call them RPC or backend services as they should mainly be part of the backend architecture and never be public facing. By default we use the namespace go.micro.srv for these but you should use your domain com.example.srv. 

## How performant is it?

Performance is not a current focus of Micro. While code is written to be optimal and avoid overhead, not much time is spent on benchmarks. Comparisons to net/http or other web frameworks make no sense. Micro provides higher level requirements for microservices that include service discovery, load balancing, message encoding, etc. To compare you would need to add all these features in.

If you're still concerned with performance. The simplest way to extract the most value is simply by running with the following flags:

```
--selector=cache # enables in memory caching of discovered nodes
--client_pool_size=10 # enables the client side connection pool
```

## Does Micro support gRPC?

Yes. There are plugins for a transport, client and server in [micro/go-plugins](https://github.com/micro/go-plugins). 

If you want a quick start just use [micro/go-grpc](https://github.com/micro/go-grpc).

## Micro vs Go-Kit

This question comes up a lot. What's the difference between micro and go-kit?

Go-kit describes itself as a standard library for microservices. Like Go, go-kit provides you with individual packages 
which can be used to construct your applications. Go-kit is great where you want complete control over how you define 
your services.

Go-micro is a pluggable RPC framework for microservices. It's an opinionated framework which attempts to simplify 
the communication aspects of distributed systems so you can focus on the business logic itself. Go-micro is great 
where you want to get up and running quickly while having something pluggable to switch out infrastructure without 
code changes.

Micro is a microservice toolkit. It's like a swiss army knife for microservices which builds on go-micro to provide 
traditional entry points like http api gateway, web ui, cli, slack bot, etc. Micro uses tooling to guide the logical 
separation of concerns in your architecture, pushing you to create an API layer of microservices for a public API and 
separately creating a WEB layer of microservices for web UIs.

Use go-kit where you want complete control. Use go-micro where you want an opinionated framework.
